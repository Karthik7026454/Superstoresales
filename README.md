# Superstoresales
Created A Superstore Dashboard using Power Bi 
--> First of all, I Downloaded SuperstoreSales Dataset from Kaggle Platform and Uploaded in Power Bi 
--> Then After uploading I Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, renaming headers, removing blank columns,etc.
--> After cleaning process, I have started with Creating Dashboards with the given data and provide outcome with necessary data through a Great Dashboard.
--> By looking at the dashboard, each and every information will be clearly visible through using various chats like KPI Card, Map, Donut Chart, Slicer etc. 
The Sum of sales, Profit And Average Delivery is shown according to Regions, Locations and Dates. 
And Finally, I Have given the titles, values, background colours, text format with bold and highlighting.
Thats all about my steps and procedures in creating a Dashboard in Superstore Sales Dataset.
